# I-RIM Dog Challenge Rule
The Dog Challenge for I-RIM is a *Locomotion* challenge. The winner of challenge will win a prize of XX €.

The aim of this challenge is to test the robot's ability to navigate various obstacles from  a point A to point B along a designated path.

* The arena is enclosed by walls, preventing the robot from exiting. 

* Participants are provided with a 3D map of the arena when they enrol in the challenge.

* There is a predefined path to follow that involves overcoming obstacles of different levels of difficulty. 

* Some obstacles like stepping stones, debris, and pieces of furniture, are strategically distributed to challenge the robot’s ability to navigate.

* Other obstacles include stairs, ramps with different slopes, tunnels, slippery terrain, and soft terrain (such as foam). Some obstacles require specific abilities, such as crawling under a low bar or jumping over a high step.

* A score is associated to each obstacle (see <a href="docs/obstacle_scores.md">obstacle_scores </a>)

* The judging committee will evaluate the percentage of completion of each task (0% up to full score)

* The scores of the overcome obstacles will be accumulated; if an obstacle is skipped the team receive 0 score

* If the robot falls there is no penalty if it is able to self-right itself. If the robot is not able to self-right itself, it needs to restart from the beginning of the obstacle.

* Everytime the robot touches the walls, a penalty of 1 point is given. 

* The judging committee reserves the right to stop any team’s attempt if considered dangerous or not following the guidelines. 



**Note:** In this challenge the robot is meant to be tele-operated. However, if the robot successfully completes the challenge in a fully autonomous manner, a x2 score multiplication factor will be applied. The score for each obstacle is determined based on its objective difficulty. The time to accomplish the task will also be an evaluation factor.
